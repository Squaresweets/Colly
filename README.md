# Colly (C# version)
Colly is a simple to use and optimized library for detecting and handling AABB collision. 

This fork is a Unity C# port of the tileworld part of colly.


**Colly.GridWorld** should be used for tile-based worlds.

## How to use
Colly works the same way as the main fork, just with c# syntax, it shouldn't be that hard to work out (hopefully)

A couple of things i haven't used have been left out, but they should be simple to add back in
